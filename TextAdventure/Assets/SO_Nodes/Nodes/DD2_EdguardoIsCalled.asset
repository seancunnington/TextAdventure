    bodyText: "You step out, gyrating and smiling like an idiot. The Kobold turns
      and stops, raising an eyebrow. It seems nonplussed and slightly annoyed. You
      didn\u2019t stop to think if it was male or female, or if Kobolds are even
      attracted to humans. It reaches a claw under the counter and you hear an alarm.
      Almost instantaneously, Edguardo the guard is there. He looks at you and stops,
      raising an eyebrow. You don\u2019t think Edguardo is impressed by your physique.
      He tells you to get your ass back to your room and dress then quietly slips
      a coin into the Kobolds hand..."
