      and stops, raising an eyebrow. It seems nonplussed and slightly annoyed. You
      didn\u2019t stop to think if it was male or female, or if Kobolds are even
      attracted to humans. It reaches a claw under the counter and you hear an alarm.

      raising an eyebrow. You don\u2019t think Edguardo is impressed by your physique.

      a coin into the Kobolds hand\u2026"
