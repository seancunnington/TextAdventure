      person you know who could help \u201CEDGUARDO!\u201D. Your hero and unfortunate
      near constant companion through the day somehow comes in the nick of time with
      guards a-plenty! You are saved! Edguardo looks a mite peeved though. He stomps
      over to you in a fury. \t\u201CYou ASS! You swiving dungheap of an unpicked
      horse hoof!!! I\u2019ve had to pay off shopkeeps to not tell everyone you can\u2019t
      keep your clothes on, I spent 3 hours cleaning your literal dung out of my
      own helmet, and saved your hide from a barroom brawl of your own making, so
      I followed you here knowing you\u2019d do something else stupid. If you weren\u2019t
      the prince, I\u2019d have your hide stripped and stomped beneath forty horses!
      You\u2019ve had your chance to start your damned foray into a dungeon and failed
      laughably. Now you\u2019re coming with me to the stunted goblin cave, Sire,
      and if you try to remove ANY of your clothes, I will never let you outside
      the castle again!\u201D Your brief foray into the world of little men is over.
      You meekly follow Edguardo, the Captain of the Royal Guard, out of the cave. "
