    bodyText: Winter air be damned! Your euphoria and idiotic confidence will keep
      you warm! You speed through the streets, women and children shrieking. You
      vault over a donkey, run up the stairs to the temple and sing songs of glory
      to all the gods! Your streak of wild abandonment continues out the gates and
      the last that is seen of Som Juan is the glow of a full moon in the trees...
