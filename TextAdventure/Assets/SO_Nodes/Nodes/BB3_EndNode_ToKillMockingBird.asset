    bodyText: "It just sounds bad, right? Maybe if you just let a little gas out,
      it\u2019ll clear up ok. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t. You freeze and hope no
      one notices. The tavern goers next to you sniff the air, and the sniffs spread
      out like the ripples in a pond. \u201COi! That guy just shit \u2018isself!\u201D
      you hear someone say. You look up and his finger is pointing right at you and
      your humiliation. There\u2019s no way to deny it, and you awkwardly walk up
      the stairs to the crowd\u2019s laughter and hide in your room forever."
