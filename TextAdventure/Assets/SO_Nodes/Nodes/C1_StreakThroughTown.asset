    bodyText: 'Clothes? Clothes are for priests and the ashamed! You...are neither.
      Swaggering down the stairs buck naked, you imagine the shrieks and gasps as
      nothing more than appreciation for the natural artwork God has bestowed you
      with. You stride out the door and into the sun to the hoots and hollers of
      the tavern goers, your pristine silhouette eclipsing the doorway. And you run.
      After several blocks of glory, you begin to feel a bit chilled and think about
      popping into a shop to grab some skivvies. '
